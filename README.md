Method to calculate the parameters of the energy signature model

Energy signature models fit piecewise functions to estimate the hourly electrical energy consumption of a building or system as a function of the outdoor temperature (or other variables). In this case, for the building simulation model in Project [RoofKIT](https://roofkit.de/en), the energy signature method is applied to the heat pump. The energy consumption of the heat pump was not available from the simulation results, therefore a data cleaning procedure was performed.
